# graph_solver_V2
A graphical solver for linear programming models

This was an assignment for linear programming 281 which I did in my second year of study. I enjoyed this project a lot.

Linear programming is a ton of theory and calculations which seemed dull, when we got the chance to develop something for the course, i got excited!
graphical solutions are usually made through a basic algorithm which is used to determine the optimal solution for a problem.

When this is complete it will remove the need for graphing on pen and paper as well as give the answers needed for the algorithm.
